## Spire-Time

This library provides type class instances allowing Spire users to
work with date and time objects.

Currently the library focuses on compatibility with
[Joda Time](http://www.joda.org/joda-time/).

This README will eventually have more information.

Spire-time is provided to you as free software under the MIT license.
